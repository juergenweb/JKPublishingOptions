# PublishingOptions
ProcessWire module to publish and unpublish pages depending on dates
(Status is Beta - so should be tested carefully!!)

This module is inspired by the SchedulePages module, but the code is completely rewritten. However, it differs from the other module in a few ways.
* Publish from and publish until date inputs will be surrounded by a fieldset
* Includes more LazyCron time intervals
* You can add/remove these fields from specific templates in the module configuration - no need to add them manually to templates
